UMKa -- User-Mode KolibriOS developer tools
===========================================

This is a common project for a set of KolibriOS developer tools which are based
on original KolibriOS kernel code wrapped and hacked as to run in the UNIX
programming environment. The idea is to make userspace UNIX tools that use as
much unchanged KolibriOS kernel source as possible to test
architecture-independent parts of the kernel in your favorite developer
environment.


umka_shell
----------

is an interactive shell with commands that are wrappers around KolibriOS kernel
syscalls and other internal functions. What works now: block layer including
disk cache, FS, UI and graphics, scheduler, ACPI/AML interpreter,
synchronization primitives, strings, slab allocator, events, unpacker, other
minor functions.

It can also be used for automated testing by feeding it a file of commands
instead of typing them.

Example:
    $ umka_shell < mytest.t > mytest.out.log


umka_fuse
---------

is like umka_shell above but commands are translated from FUSE calls, not
entered manually or read from a file. Can *potentially* be used to run xfstests
(cross-fs-tests) and automated tests against reference FS implementation.


umka_os
-------

is KolibriOS kernel running main loop (osloop), scheduler and all the threads
including network stack.


tools
-----

mkdirrange

mkfilepattern

lfbviewx


BUILD
-----

$ KOLIBRI=/path/to/kolibrios make

/path/to/kolibrios is where you checked out `svn co svn://kolibrios.org`.


Architecture
------------

Kernel services are replaced with stubs, wrappers around userspace
implementation or libc calls. Block devices are emulated with regular files.
Framebuffer can be dumped to disk as image file.


Testing
-------

sudo cp --parents /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/?SDT* /sys/bus/pci/devices/*/config .


Troubleshooting
---------------

# sysctl -w kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=0
# sysctl -w vm.mmap_min_addr=0
