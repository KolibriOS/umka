KOFU & KOFUSE
=============

This is a common project for two related tools, kofu and kofuse. The idea is to
make userspace UNIX tools that use unchanged KolibriOS block and FS source to
test these kernel parts in your favorite developer environment.


Kofu
----

is Kolibri Filesystem in Userspace.
It is an interactive shell with commands that are wrappers around KolibriOS
kernel block and FS functions.


Kofuse
------

is a short for KolibriOS and FUSE [1]. Like kofu above but commands are
translated from FUSE calls, not entered manually.


BUILD
-----

$ KOLIBRIOS=/path/to/kolibrios make

/path/to/kolibrios is where you did `svn co svn://kolibrios.org`.


Architecture
------------

Kernel services are replaced with stubs or libc calls. Block devices are
emulated with wrappers around regular files. Shell and FUSE FS are written in C.
